# Voice Translator Using Python

This is a project that implements a voice translator using Python. The application captures audio input from the user and uses speech recognition to identify the language being spoken. It then uses a translation library to convert the speech to the desired language.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)
- Google Translate library (`pip install googletrans`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/voice-translator-python.git
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install SpeechRecognition googletrans
```
3. Run the script:
```
python voice_translator.py
```
4. Speak a sentence or phrase in the language you want to translate. The application will automatically detect the language and translate it to the default language (English). You can change the default language by modifying the `target_language` variable in the code.
